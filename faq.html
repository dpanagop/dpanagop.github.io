            At EY he has managed teams building graph-enhanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
            systems, agentic due diligence tools, and early warning systems that use GenAI to process
            news for banking clients. He has also participated in AI lifecycle strategy and AI system
            reviews for global NGOs, and teaches GenAI concepts in his academic lectureship.

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-sm">
            Topological Data Analysis (TDA) uses tools from algebraic topology — such as persistent
            homology — to analyse the shape of data. Dimitrios has published academic work connecting
            TDA with clustering algorithms and lazy learning, and has applied these ideas to
            practical data science problems. His 2022 arXiv paper
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09054" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

            Greek and European banks — covering projects in credit risk, customer segmentation,
            non-performing loan management, hard collection systems, loyalty analytics, and digital
            channel optimisation. He has also worked with a global shipping company and international
            NGOs on AI strategy and governance.
